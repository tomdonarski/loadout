A side project inspired by Warzone's weapon configurator.

Having earned MSc in Mechanical Engineering, I've aquired an itch to think how are the things I see designed and manufactured.
After doing software development for a while, I've developed a similar reflex but with regard to programming.

Couple of weeks ago, when playing Warzone I took a closer look at the weaponry configurator. I've thought it'd be a cool exercise to try doing this on my own.
